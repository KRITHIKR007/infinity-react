# Image Setup Instructions

## Missing Hero Pattern Image

The application requires a hero pattern image at `public/images/hero-pattern.png`. 

To create this image:

1. Run the provided script to generate a placeholder SVG:
```
node scripts/create-placeholder.js
```

2. Convert the resulting SVG to PNG using any image editor or online converter

3. Place the PNG file at `public/images/hero-pattern.png`

4. Alternatively, you can use your own background pattern image by placing it at the same location

## Other Required Images

Make sure you also have the following images:
- `public/images/placeholder.jpg` - Generic placeholder for missing images
- `public/images/GooglePay_QR (2).png` - Cultural events payment QR code
- `public/images/IMG_1787.PNG` - Technical events payment QR code
